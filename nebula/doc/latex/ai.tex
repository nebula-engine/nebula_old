\item Could be method of AI.
\item Could create \char`\"{}peripheral devices\char`\"{} which connect to the generic outputs of the assembly language. Algorithm would then evolve to use the device no matter what the device is. This allows for game-\/specific customization of behavior using a generic assembly language by hard-\/coding object which can be controlled by the algorithm.
