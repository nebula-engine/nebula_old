For celestial bodies, each body has an aabb. The size of the aabb depends on the body's mass and velcoity. If two bodies have overlapping aabb, their motion is solved by kinetics (force, velocity).

If the aabb overlaps nothing, the body travels in a straight line or depends only on its own forces (thrusters).
