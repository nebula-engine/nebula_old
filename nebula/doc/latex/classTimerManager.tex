Timer Manager  


{\ttfamily \#include $<$FR\_\-TI\_\-TimerManager.h$>$}

\subsection{Detailed Description}
Timer Manager The \hyperlink{classTimerManager}{TimerManager} stores Timers in a container. Timers are sorted by ascending time remaining so that only the timer at the front of the container needs to be checked during each update of the manager. The container should have a fast insert method, since new timers will be inserted into the correct position in order to keep the container sorted. 

The documentation for this class was generated from the following file:\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
