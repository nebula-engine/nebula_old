\item For rts-\/style games, have a single resource type. Each unit of resource has a value in a continuous range (like electromagnetic spectrum). Resources can be converted to different values at a cost (conversion efficiency). Different purchasable things could require different combinations of values. This could work well with evolutionary algorithm-\/based populations which could evolve to feed on different values.
\item Steal idea from 0x10c and have fully programmable 16-\/bit computer to control various things (like a spaceship). Or perhaps a more advanced computer with a c-\/like programming language. This would be easier for programming things like launch and re-\/rentry sequences for spacecraft.
