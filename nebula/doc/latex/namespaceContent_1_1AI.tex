AI  


\subsection{Detailed Description}
AI 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Path finding
\item Automatic path generation
\item Target finding, stalking, chacing
\item decision making
\item Evolutionary Algorithms
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Could be method of \hyperlink{namespaceContent_1_1AI}{AI}.
\item Could create \char`\"{}peripheral devices\char`\"{} which connect to the generic outputs of the assembly language. Algorithm would then evolve to use the device no matter what the device is. This allows for game-\/specific customization of behavior using a generic assembly language by hard-\/coding object which can be controlled by the algorithm.

\item Neural Networks
\item Fuzzy Logic
